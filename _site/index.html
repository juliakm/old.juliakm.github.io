        Building Drupal Forums at AASHE
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2009</span>

    <p>The idea of building a Campus Sustainability Forum has been kicking around <a href="http://www.aashe.org" title="AASHE">my organization</a> for years. When the organization was choosing a CMS about three years ago, one of the major reasons we went with Drupal was the forum integration. </p>

<p>The goal of the <a href="http://www.aashe.org/forums" title="AASHE Forums">AASHE Campus Sustainability Forums</a> is to provide a central place where those interested in campus sustainability can ask and answer questions, share knowledge and expertise, and contribute to the growing body of knowledge on campus sustainability.</p>

<p>Currently, most information about campus sustainability is exchanged via the <a href="http://listserv.brown.edu/?A0=GRNSCH-L">Green Schools Listserv</a>. While this listserv is an excellent way of quickly asking questions and getting responses, there was no one location where all of the discussion is archived and easily searched. Our goal in building the Campus Sustainability Forums was to fill this void. </p>

<p>Before we started work on the forums, my co-workers scoured other web forums around the web and came back with a number of features requests from other forums. While the core Forum module met some of these requests, I found myself looking for additional modules to achieve most of the forum functionality. Here&#39;s an overview of how I used the core module and contributed modules to build the forums. </p>

<h2 id="core_forum_module_functionality">
  Core Forum Module Functionality
</h2>

<p><em>Create forum posts and Respond to forum posts via comments</em> Using the core Forum module, users with different permission levels are able to create posts and respond to posts with comments. Forum topics are a node type and all users are able to create forum topics. However, as explained later, only specific roles can automatically publish their topics.</p>

<p><em>Mark posts as sticky</em> We wanted to be able to highlight more relevant or timely topics by having them stick to the top of topic listing pages. This is easily achieved by marking a post as sticky. In fact, this is one of the few times when I have been able to easily explain to end users what the sticky checkbox means. </p>

<p><em>Organize posts by taxonomy</em> AASHE has an existing classification for campus sustainability that is used within the site and is based on the <a href="http://www.aashe.org/stars">Sustainability Tracking And Reporting System (STARS)</a>. We were able to easily create a Forum vocabulary with these terms. I used the helpful <a href="http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_csv">Taxonomy CSV</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_xml">Taxonomy XML</a> modules to export and import taxonomies between our development, staging, and live sites. One problem that we ran into was having a forum that could be organized by multiple taxonomies, which was an initial requirement. Although you can assign new taxonomies to forum topic posts, the forum itself can only be organized by one vocabulary. This is a limitation that I wasn’t able to get around. </p>

<p><em>RSS feed for each forum</em> Since the forum is organized by taxonomy terms, there is an automatic RSS feed for each forum. Having separate RSS Feeds was one of our earliest requirements because someone interested in the Curriculum forum is not necessarily interested in the Waste one. One slight problem we’ve run into is that our users don’t expect the RSS icon to be for a different set of posts when you are on a taxonomy page. We are going to add some help text to further explain this later on. </p>

<p><em>Anonymous block to encourage users to sign-in</em> When we first tested the forum, we noticed that users were confused about how to sign in from the forums main page. To get around this, I created a block only shown to anonymous users encouraging logging in. </p>

<p><em>Individual topic areas can be co-branded with partner associations. For example, the ACUPCC sponsors the <a href="http://www.aashe.org/forums/climate">Climate Forum</a></em> While there’s no section-sponsor setup out of the box with the forum module, it was relatively easy to use blocks that appear only on particular pages to set up forum sponsors. For example, the ACUPCC sponsors our Climate forum and this sponsorship is recognized in a block. In a future version of the forum, it would be ideal to attach forum sponsors to taxonomy terms as an additional field. This should be possible in Drupal 7. </p>

<h2 id="adding_contributed_modules">
  Adding Contributed Modules
</h2>

<p><em>Look and feel can be customized to match main AASHE website</em> Once I started designing the forum, I quickly found that it was challenging to make the look-and-feel of the forum match the AASHE website. However, the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/advanced_forum">Advanced Forum</a> module provides a number of presets themes that make theming a lot easier. I used the Naked theme and was able to create a forum design in a few hours. </p>

<p><em>Ability for users to sign up for email notification (by email or RSS) of replies</em> While the RSS functionality is taken care of by the core forum module, email subscriptions were more complicated to implement. I ended up using the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/notifications">Notifications</a> module, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/token">Token</a> module, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/messaging">Messaging</a>, and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/mimemail">Mimemail</a>. Notifications and Messaging made it easy to create templates that are sent out in response to certain events such as a new comment being posted. Users are automatically sent HTML emails (using Mimemail) and can subscribe by taxonomy term, author name, content type, and thread to email notifications. However, we’ve had a bit of difficulty communicating this functionality to our users. </p>

<p><em>Sponsors recognized in random order on the main forums page</em> To make sure that our forum had an active base of users, we sought out sponsors. In exchange for promoting the forums, sponsor logos are presented in random order on the right side of the page and listed in text alphabetically at the bottom of each forum page. This is all accomplished using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/imagecache">Imagecache</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/link">Link</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/filefield">FileField</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/imagefield">ImageField</a>. I set up a sponsor node type where users can enter the sponsor name, a link to the sponsor website, and upload an image that is resized to 125 pixels wide. The list of sponsor images on the right is a Views block that displays in random order and the text list on the bottom of the page is a different Views block. </p>

<p><em>AASHE staff logo to accompany staff posts, AASHE member logo accompanies member posts</em> We were able to easily use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/user_badges">User Badges</a> module to create logos to accompany member and staff posts. The goal of this is to draw attention to “official” answers in the forum and to also highlight our members. </p>

<p><em>When non-members submit posts, they are not published and the AASHE moderators receive an automatic notification.</em> It has been hard to figure out how to best moderate forum posts and avoid having the forum overrun with spam and posts that violate our terms of use. Our current solution is to post any content from members without review but save as draft any posts from non-members. To accomplish this, I set up a rule using the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules module</a> that emails a notification to our staff moderator when we have a new non-member post or comment and also sets it as a draft. In the future, I am going to write a module that assigns all .edu email addresses a role and that role can automatically post to the forum without review. </p>

<p><em>The “Real Name” and not the username should show up everywhere for users</em> We don’t ever use usernames on the AASHE website and instead override all names using the RealName module. Without any modifications, the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/realname">RealName module</a> replaced all of our usernames (set with theme_username) with our profile First + Last name combination. </p>

<p><em>Users can “quote” one another in forum threads</em> One features that our staff really liked on other forums was the ability to quote other posts. Using the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/quote">Quote module</a>, we were able to add this button and functionality. However, since Quote doesn’t use theme_username, we had to write a <a href="http://drupal.org/node/364871%23comment-2129570">small patch</a> to the module. </p>

<p><em>Display recent posts categorized by relevant taxonomy term throughout the site</em> We wanted to be able to have relevant posts show up depending on where a user is within our site. For example, if they are looking at a Climate resource, they would see relevant Climate posts in a list block. This was implemented on our development site using Views and arguments. However, it is not implemented on the live site yet. </p>

<h2 id="deploying">
  Deploying
</h2>

<p>One of the trickiest parts of deploying our forum was that so much of the functionality was tied up in contributed modules and database code. I ended up using the Features module to bundle together the required modules, Views, content types, and imagecache presets from development to staging to live site. Feature alone didn’t capture all of the settings, so I also practiced my live migration by first moving from our development to staging site and writing down all of the little configuration settings and then using that list to move to the live site. Please let me know if you are interested in having a copy of the feature. </p>

<h2 id="how_it_all_came_together">
  How It All Came Together
</h2>

<p>In the first screenshot, you can see the anonymous user block on the left, as well as a sponsor/description block. On the right, you can see our sponsor view that presents a list of logos and an example of real names being used in the last post listing. </p>

In the second screenshot, you can see an example of member badges, our recent posts view, the subscription option and the ability to quote posts. </p>

<h2>So, How Long Did It Take?</h2>

<p>I probably spent between 50 and 60 hours building the forums and my co-worker Matt worked 5 to 10 hours. A significant amount of my time was spent trying out and then discarding modules that didn&#39;t quite meet our needs. It also took awhile to figure out how to configure Mimemail with Notifications.</p>

        Drupalcamp Atlanta Presentation: Why do Drupal Projects Fail?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2009</span>

    <p>As co-organizer of the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/triangle-nc-raleigh-durham-chapel-hill">Triangle Drupal group</a>, I&#39;ve met some great people who have had some terrible experiences with Drupal. At the same time, I have become increasingly frustrated by my inability to accurately predict what Drupal projects will succeed and which will fail. For the past few months, I&#39;ve been thinking about how I can try and more accurately predict what Drupal projects will be successful. Instead of only drawing from my own experiences and anecdotal evidence, I thought it would be helpful to put together a survey. I <a href="http://twitter.com/juliakm/status/4056855118">distributed the survey via Twitter</a> and had about 25 responses. While this is by no means a scientific study, I do think that others might find the results helpful. I summarized the results yesterday when I presented at Drupalcamp Atlanta yesterday on, &quot;Why do Drupal Projects Fail?: Evaluating Success Factors and When to Use Drupal.&quot; <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JuliaKM/why-do-drupal-projects-fail-evaluating-success-factors-and-when-to-use-drupal">You can find the slides here</a>. For those of you who don&#39;t have time to read the slides (or watch the video which Drupalcamp Atlanta should have up soon), here are my key findings. </p>

<h3>What are the common patterns of Drupal project success?</h3>

<p><strong>Early Goal Setting Avoids Scope Creep</strong>: Projects where all of the stakeholders identified and set project goals early were much more likely to report having adequate specifications, and less likely to report scope creep. I thought that this was interesting since I’ve spent a lot of time as a developer whining about specs and less time thinking about overall goals. <em>Advice</em>: Since projects that devoted time to setting goals had more accurate specifications, you need to evaluate whether you have time to devote to setting goals before you start your project. Although it is tempting to jump right into specifications, it makes more sense to take a step back and evaluate how each member of your project team is defining project success. </p>

<p><strong>On-Going Project Audits Make a Difference</strong>: Projects with on-going audits were more likely to be fully completed (no abandonment) and finished on schedule. <em>Advice</em>: Before you begin, you need to make sure that you have identified someone unbiased on your team who can spend time checking deliverables against milestones. I suggest that this person is not someone doing the design or development work on your project. It can be very hard to keep your perspective on the milestones when you are coding all day and want to make everyone happy. </p>

<p><strong>Module Performance Matters</strong>: If more than 90 percent of Drupal modules do not work as expected or meet user requirements, projects will run into schedule problems and experience scope creep. <em>Advice</em>: From my perspective, this is the most critical factor. The big question you need to answer is, &quot;Can you accurately make predictions about how modules will perform?&quot; If you cannot, can you pay to hire someone who can. Unfortunately, learning how to accurately predict whether modules will meet user needs can take a long time to figure out. </p>

<p><strong>Non-Developers Need to Understand Drupal</strong>: Projects completed on schedule without scope creep are built by developers working with technical project managers and stakeholders who “get” Drupal. <em>Advice</em>: I&#39;d suggest that you introduce everyone on your team to Drupal before starting your project. I highly recommend the Lullabot video, <a href="http://store.lullabot.com/products/understanding-drupal">Understanding Drupal</a>, for everyone on your team. It will give your whole team, in a very non-threatening way, an solid understanding of Drupal. </p>

<p><strong>Beware of Big Projects</strong>: Large projects (over 1,500 pages) were more likely to go over budget and schedule. <em>Advice</em>: Big Drupal projects need more attention and are going to be inherently risky. If you have a big project (1,500+ pages, lots of module complexity), you need to be willing to alter cost, scope, or budget down the road. It is best to build a lot of padding into your schedule for larger projects. I&#39;ve attached the <a href="http://www.juliakm.com/resources/Drupalpilotsurvey_raw_data_1.zip">raw data from my survey</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JuliaKM/why-do-drupal-projects-fail-evaluating-success-factors-and-when-to-use-drupal">my presentation is on Slideshare</a>. Please let me know if you have any questions and feel free to re-use any of the questions or slides.</p>

        How to Move a Drupal Site to a New Host Without Going Crazy
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 May 2009</span>

    <h3 id="preparation">
  Preparation
</h3>

<p><em>A. Upgrade modules and Drupal core code</em></p>

<p>Although it’s tempting to move your files and database quickly, I strongly recommend doing some preparation first. Before I move Drupal site, I always first check for any new Drupal core and module updates. If there are modules that need to be updated, I do the update before moving my site. The advantage of this is that it is easier later on to debug any problems that arise during the migration if you are already using the latest version of all Drupal code. </p>

<p><em>B. Check your version of PHP and MySQL on the new and current host</em></p>

<p>Some Drupal modules require PHP 5.x. I’ve run into problems before when I move over code to a new server that is running PHP 4.x. </p>

<p>To check your PHP version, log into your new and old servers separately via ssh and run the following:</p>

<p><code>php -v</code> 
<em>Helpful advice from Scor in the comments:</em> The PHP CLI is not always installed and php -v might not work, or if it does it might be a different version than the one Apache runs. In any case that does not mean you cannot use Drupal on the server. Another way to check these things is to try to install a dummy Drupal core site and see if it works ok. 
To check what version of MySQL you are using, open MySQL via the shell on your computer and type:</p>

<p><code>status</code> 
If you are running different versions of PHP and/or MySQL on your new and old servers, be sure to check for any incompatibilities with your modules. Any module that requires PHP 5.x should say so in the README.txt document. I highly recommend making sure that your new host uses PHP 5.x before switching. </p>

<p>You can also check the PHP and MySQL versions of your old site via Drupal on the status page at admin/reports/status.</p>

<h3 id="create_your_new_domain">
  Create Your New Domain
</h3>

<p><em>C. Create your new domain at your new host</em></p>

<p>Depending on your host, there are many ways that you could go about creating your domain. For most hosts, there will be a tool where you can define your new domain. It is important to note that creating your domain at your new host will not move your site. You will need to change your DNS records for that to happen. </p>

<h3 id="moving_databases">
  Moving Databases
</h3>

<p><em>D. Export your Drupal database using phpMyAdmin</em></p>

<p><em>Note:</em> If you do not have phpMyAdmin and are not familiar with the command-line, an alternative option is to use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate">Backup and Migrate module</a>. </p>

<p>If you decide to use phpMyAdmin, I recommend truncating (emptying) the cache tables before you export your database. Go to all of the tables that start with cache_ and select the &quot;Empty&quot; tab. You can also manually clear Views Cache within the Views module. </p>

<p>To export a database using phpMyAdmin, go to the database and select the “Export” tab. I recommend checking the “Extended inserts” checkbox and saving your export as a “gzipped” file. </p>

<p><em>E. Create the database on your new host</em></p>

<p>Depending on your hosting provider, there are many ways that you can go about creating a database. I recommend creating a database with the same name as the one on your old host. </p>

<p><em>F. Import your SQL file</em></p>

<p>Once you have a database on your new host, you can go and import the SQL file you downloaded to your desktop using phpMyAdmin. Select your new, empty database and then click the “Import” tab. Under the “File to import” option, you can upload your file. Once the file is uploaded, you can select “Go.”</p>

<p><em>Warning</em>: If you have a large site, importing your file into your new database can take a really long time. Do not stop the operation. Just wait. If your import times out, then you will need to look at importing using command-line or a program like <a href="http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump.php">BigDump</a>. </p>

<p><em>G. Moving files</em></p>

<p>If you are not familiar with the command-line, you can download all of your files to your desktop and then upload them to your new host using FTP. However, this process can be very slow. I recommend using secure copy (scp) instead. </p>

<p>To use scp, you first need to know where your files are on your current site. Log into your old site using ssh or ftp and get the path to your web directory from the server root. Once you are in the correct directory, enter:</p>

<p><code>pwd</code> 
Copy the output to somewhere you’ll be able to find again. </p>

<p>Next, log into your new host and go to the directory where you want the new files to go. The following worked for me:</p>

<p><code>scp -rp myusername@www.myoldhost.com:[/home/myusername/www.myoldhost.com/public_html]/* .</code> 
The part after the colon, in brackets, is the path you just copied on your old site. <u>The brackets are just here as an example, do not include them when you scp.</u></p>

<p>This command copies everything in the public_html folder on my old host to the current folder of my new host. the -p flag preserves permissions and the -r flag recursively copies so that you get the content of your folders.</p>

<p>Be sure to check and make sure that the .htaccess file copied over as well. </p>

<p><em>Note:</em> You could also use subversion, git or another version control system to download the new files provided that you host your repository on a different site than your old host. If you are doing this, then you probably have already moved past this step.

  Setting Up and Testing the New Site
</h3></p>

<p><em>H: Edit Settings.php</em> To correctly configure your database, edit your settings.php with your new domain information. Be sure to scan through settings.php and remove any settings that you may have added that only relate to your old host. </p>

<p><em>I: Edit Your Hosts File</em></p>

<p>You can test your site locally by editing your hosts file. By editing your hosts file, you will be able to see what your site looks like before making the DNS switch. </p>

<p>I have a Mac and edit my hosts file in “private/etc/hosts.” To test it, I added a new line where the first column is the IP address of my new site and the second is the domain I’m testing. </p>

<pre>IP address of new site      www.mydomainname.com
69.123.11.11                www.juliakm.com
</pre>

<p>The hosts file is a little trickier to find on Windows machines.This Wikipedia article gives a list of host file locations for different operating systems.</p> 
<em>J: Test your site locally</em></p>

<p>Once you have your new site showing up using your hosts fix, make sure to test your new site. I recommend trying the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>  Log in</li>
<li>  Check your site status at admin/reports/status</li>
<li>  Create a post</li>
<li>  Edit an existing post</li>
<li>  Post a comment</li>
<li>  View your module list at admin/build/modules/list</li>
</ul>

<p><em>K: Fix any problems</em></p>

<p>A few problems that I’ve run into before are: </p>

<ul>
<li>  Not making my files/ directory writable</li>
<li>  Not having the GD Library installed at my new host</li>
</ul>

<p>For the GD Library, you’ll have to talk to your new hosting provider. For the files directory, go to the directory above your files directory and enter via command-line: </p>

<p><code>chmod -R 755 files</code> 
If you are confused about the “chmod” command, search for it on Drupal.org. There is a wealth of information available there. </p>

<p><em>L: Undo hosts file changes</em></p>

<p>Go back to your hosts file and reverse any changes you made. </p>

<p><em>M: Set up your cron job</em></p>

<p>Depending on your familiarity with command-line, you can do this via crontab or a tool provided by your hosting company. If your hosting company does not have a tool and you do not want to touch the command-line, check out the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/poormanscron">Poorman’s Cron module</a>. </p>

<h3 id="make_the_switch">
  Make the Switch
</h3>

<p><em>N: Your last step is to switch your nameservers from your old site to new site.</em></p>

<p>Your new hosting company should have provided you with nameservers that correspond to your new server. To point your site to these, you’ll need to go to your domain registrar and edit the DNS records. If your registrar is your old host, you can do this there. If you used another registrar such as GoDaddy, then you’ll need to edit the DNS records there. </p>

<p><em>O: Wait 15 minutes to 48 hours and obsessively check “whois”</em></p>

<p>It takes awhile for DNS changes to propagate. You’ll have to wait at least 15 minutes for the change to take place. Depending on where you live in the country and your registrar, it could take even longer. You can check and see if the switch has happened by typing the following into the command-line:</p>

<p><code>host mysite.com</code> 
Next, copy the IP address. Then do: </p>

<p><code>whois IPAddress</code> 
You can also check for whois information online using <a href="http://www.domaintools.com">DomainTools</a>. </p>
