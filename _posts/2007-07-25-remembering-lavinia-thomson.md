Eric and I have spent the last couple days in New Hampshire mourning the loss of his grandmother, [Lavinia Thomson][1]. During the service, the topic of community was frequently mentioned. Lavinia, who the family called Nana, lived on a main road and could often be seen waving from a chair on her lawn at passing cars and chatting with neighbors. It is amazing to think that this small act brightened the day of so many passing motorists. At the service, someone mentioned that Lavinia was one of the the last of an era that valued community and kindness. 
> She will be remembered as a wonderful mother, mother-in-law, nana and friend. She loved to sing, dance and most of all spend time with her family. She always had a smile and a friendly word for everyone.

 I feel lucky that I had the opportunity to meet Nana. She will be missed.
