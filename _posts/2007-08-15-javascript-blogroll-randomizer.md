[Eric][1] uses Blogger and wanted to have a random list of 10 blogs from his blogroll display each time someone visited his blog. Since Blogger doesn't let its members upload PHP files, I used the following Javascript to create a random blog listing for him. The code is a slightly modified version of what I found [here][2]. 

**8/28/2007 Update:** Be sure to include the backslashes before single quotes and apostrophes. [Chicken Girl][3] wrote a great explanation of why this is important at [Cranky Fitness][4]. `
