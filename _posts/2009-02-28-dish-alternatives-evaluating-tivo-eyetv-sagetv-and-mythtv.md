Eric and I have been trying to save money and after Dish let us know that prices would be going up again, I started investigating alternatives. We both have realized that we can live without cable but not without DVR. Watching American Idol live is a painful experience. It’s must skip TV. 

It seems like there are two big options. We can go with a bundled system or go with a combo of software and an HD tuner stick. I already have an unused Mac Mini available for DVR duties. 

In no particular order, here are the options we’re exploring.

The cheapest DVR with HD is $299. We’d also have to pay between $10.75 and $12.95 a month for service. 

<h5 id="advantages">
  Advantages
</h5>

*   Nice interface
*   Netflix integration
*   We have used it before and liked it
*   Web-integration: we can set programs to record from our computer

<h5 id="disadvantages">
  Disadvantages

*   Locked into a 1-year service contract

Total cost for first 2 years: ~$550

All of the options below assume that you’ve purchased an HD TV tuner for between $70 and $120.
